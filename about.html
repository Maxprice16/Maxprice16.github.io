		<p>	Who are you? </p>
		<p> No, I mean <em>who are you?</em></p>
		<p> No, not your profession, or your place of origin, your age, or gender, or the hobbies you like to do. You.	

		<p>These questions are a paraphrase of a scene from the movie, Anger Management starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. I don't know why, but this scene always stuck with me. If we chose not to define ourselves by the work we produce or where we are from or the characteristics of our mortal coil, then how do we define ourselves? </p>
