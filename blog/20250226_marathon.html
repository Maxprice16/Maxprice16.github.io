		<p>Because of some compulsion that I have a hard time understanding myself, I am constantly training for some kind of endurance race. Right now, that event is a Marathon. I am planning to run the Eugene Marathon in April 2025, and this time I am running against a time goal rather than just running to finish. I am hoping to complete this race in under 3:10, and hopefully even faster than that. Success will depend on discipline in training right for the next 7 weeks or so, as well as appropriate preparation on the actual race day.</p>
		<p>In this post, I want to explain what I've been doing in training for the last couple of months, as well as talk about what I'll plan on doing up until race day. I will continue making posts about my marathon training leading up to the race. As my skills with website building grow, I'll try to add in stats, graphs, and charts to explain my training and detail some of my workouts.</p>
