		<p>Because of my side hustle as a Brand Ambassador for hard spirits, I end up with a lot of booze in the house. Right now, I have a lot of inventoried whiskey that I've been trying to make my way though. While it's hard to play favorites with free whiskey, I wanted to give a short list of my favorites </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Four Roses Barrel Select</li>
			<li>Woodinville Bourbon</li>
			<li>Oban 14yr Scotch</li>
		</ol>

		<p>These are just a few of my favorite, but I have many more bottles at the house that I still need to drink through. Please come help me!</p> <br>
